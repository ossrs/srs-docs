# Speak to the Future: Transform Your Browser into a Personal Voice-Driven GPT AI Assistant with SRS Stack

Imagine engaging with GPT in your browser through voice alone, sharing this capability with friends, or accessing
it from any location. Picture an AI assistant that makes learning spoken English enjoyable and straightforward, or 
that enables seamless conversation between you and a friend speaking a different language by translating everything 
instantly. Discover how to turn these exciting possibilities into reality!

<!--truncate-->

Introducing a cutting-edge to technology: our easy to build, browser-based, voice-driven GPT AI assistant,
a transformative tool in interaction. Built with the user-friendly SRS Stack, which effortlessly enables
HTTPS with a single click, this AI assistant is accessible on any device equipped with a browser, including PCs and 
mobile phones. Its convenience allows you to communicate with your private GPT AI assistant effortlessly, anytime 
and anywhere, making it the perfect solution for hands-free use and quick input. Ideal for improving your spoken 
English, acting as a real-time translator, or simply serving as a smart companion, this voice-driven AI assistant 
works well through conversation.

## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by One Click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name srs-stack -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt` via a browser.

## Step 2: Setup HTTPS for Voice-Driven GPT

When integrating voice functionality into your browser-based GPT AI assistant, security becomes paramount.
Browsers require the use of HTTPS when accessing the microphone to capture voice inputs as part of their 
security strategies. This might sound complex, but with SRS Stack, enabling HTTPS on your site is 
straightforward and hassle-free. Here's how to secure your voice-driven AI assistant with HTTPS:

1. **DNS Configuration**: Begin by adding a DNS A record for your domain. This step directs your domain name to your SRS Stack server. To verify that the DNS setup is correct, try accessing your SRS Stack with your domain name via http, like `http://your_domain_name`. If the setup is correct, this should work without any issues.

2. **Enable HTTPS**: Navigate to the `System > HTTPS > Let's Encrypt` section in your SRS Stack dashboard. Here, you'll simply input your domain name and hit the `Submit` button. This process initiates the automatic generation and installation of a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your domain, making the setup of HTTPS as easy as a single click.

3. **Verification**: With HTTPS enabled, you can now access your SRS Stack site securely by using `https://your_domain_name`. This secure connection ensures the security of your interactions with the GPT AI assistant.

For more details, please see [Setup HTTPS for SRS Stack](./2022-04-12-SRS-Stack-HTTPS.md). By following these 
steps, you'll ensure that your voice-driven GPT AI assistant is not only innovative and useful but also secure 
and compliant with browser security standards.

## Step 3: Setup OpenAI Secret Key in Live Room

To use AI services, you must obtain a secret key from OpenAI. Please open the [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
page in your browser and click the `Create new secret key` button. Once the key is created, copy it and set it in SRS Stack.

Next, as illustrated in the image below, navigate to `Scenarios > LiveRoom > Create Live Room` and press the 
`Create` button to create a live room for conversing with the GPT AI assistant. Alternatively, select the link to 
join an existing live room.

Next, configure the OpenAI secret key in `LiveRoom > AI Assistant > AI Provider`. Afterward, click on the 
`Test OpenAI Service` button, and if no errors are detected during testing, click on `Update AI Assistant`.

All you need to set up! It's quite user-friendly. 

## Step 4: Open GPT AI Assistant in Browser

Now, click the `Assistant Link` button to create a link. You can either click the link to open the browser-based, 
voice-driven GPT AI assistant. You can also right-click the link to copy and share the URL with other devices or 
friends. You can use this on your mobile device as well.

Your AI assistant is now prepared; let's explore how to communicate with her.

## Step 5: How to Interact with GPT AI Assistant

When using a browser-based voice-driven GPT AI assistant on a computer, such as an Apple Mac or a Windows PC, 
click on the microphone icon on the webpage. Press and hold either the `SPACE` or `R` key to begin speaking, 
and release the key to stop speaking.

When utilizing the AI assistant on a mobile device browser, like iPhone or Android, press and hold the microphone 
for speaking, and release to finish speaking.

Once you've submitted your message to the AI assistant, please wait briefly. The AI assistant will respond to you
using text and voice as well.

> Note: Moreover, a text input feature permits you to enter text by typing or pasting from the clipboard. Upon using 
voice input, the input text field auto-fills, enabling you to edit and resend it to the AI assistant.

That's it! Now, let me present some intriguing and practical real-world examples and how to do it via your 
browser-based voice-driven GTP AI assistant.

## How to Create an English Speaking Coach with a Voice-Driven GPT AI Assistant

Once you've configured your voice-driven GPT AI assistant, you can update the bellow prompt at the setting webpage 
`AI Assistant > AI Instructions > Instructions`. You can get an excellent language coach who is tireless, humble, 
doesn't lose temper, and patiently accompanies you in your spoken language practice. After using it for a month,
I progressed from speaking word by word to speaking sentence by sentence.

```text
I want you to act as a spoken English teacher and improver. 
I will speak to you in English and you will reply to me in English to practice my spoken English. 
I want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes, typos, and factual errors. 
I want you to ask me a question in your reply. 
Now let's start practicing, you could ask me a question first. 
Remember, I want you to strictly correct my grammar mistakes, typos, and factual errors.
```

## How to Create a Simultaneous Translator for Multilingual Users

By sharing your voice-activated GPT AI assistant to more than one user, allowing them to converse with the same AI 
assistant, then you get a simultaneous translator. You need to prompt the AI assistant to convert text into various 
languages. 

Please change the languages in the prompt to yours, updat the prompt at `AI Assistant > AI Instructions > Instructions`:

```text
I want you to act as a language translator.
I want you to translate my text in conversational tone.
I want you to strictly translate to English and Chinese.
Keep in mind that you must translate to English and Chinese.
Remember, never answer questions but only translate.
```
