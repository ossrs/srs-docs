# Mastering Virtual Live Events: Harness the Power of Pre-Recorded Content for Seamless and Engaging Live Streaming Experiences

## Introduction

Virtual live events refers to converting recorded video files, devices, or network streams into live 
broadcasts and pushing them to live streaming platforms. For example, in e-commerce live streaming, 
you can pre-record product explanations and demonstrations. In educational live streaming, you can 
pre-record lessons and play them in the live classroom. For online speeches and sharing, you can 
play pre-recorded content in the live room. 

Virtual live events allows streamers to have plenty of preparation time, making the content more polished. 
It helps reduce anxiety for inexperienced streamers, prevents network issues, enables 24/7 live streaming, 
reaches a wider audience, and offers more possibilities for live broadcasts.

SRS Stack enables you to create virtual live events with just one click, broadcasting them to multiple platforms
like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to create a virtual live
event using SRS Stack.

In today's fast-paced world, virtual live events are becoming increasingly popular due to the convenience 
they offer. Whether it's a concert, a soccer game, or an online course, you can now create a virtual live 
event with your video files, making them more interactive and accessible to a wider audience. 

## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by one click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp --name srs-stack \
  -v $HOME/data:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt`.

## Step 2: Upload your video file

Once you've created your SRS Stack, open the dashboard and navigate to `Scenarios > VirtualLive > YouTube`. 
Click on `Choose File`, select your video file, and then click `Upload File`.

## (Optional) Upload Video File by Other Tools

You can also upload the video file to the `/data/upload` folder using tools like FTP or SCP. After that, choose 
`Use server file`, enter the video file's path, and utilize it as a virtual live source.

This method enables you to upload very large files, particularly when webpage-based uploads fail. By using professional 
upload tools, you can resume uploads or accelerate the process with multi-threading and other features.
