# Maximize Audience Engagement: Effortlessly Restream Live Content Across Multiple Platforms with Oryx

In today's digital world, live streaming has become an essential tool for businesses, content creators, and individuals to engage with their audiences. With the increasing popularity of various live streaming platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook, it has become crucial to stream your content on multiple platforms simultaneously to reach a wider audience. This blog will guide you through the process of live streaming to multiple platforms using Oryx.

Oryx is a powerful and easy-to-use solution that allows you to live stream to multiple platforms with just a few clicks. It also enables you to stream to your own platform or even set up an intranet live stream within your company. Let's dive into the steps to set up live streaming on multiple platforms using Oryx.

### Step 1: Create Oryx by One Click

Creating an Oryx is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an Oryx with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp --name srs-stack \
  -v $HOME/data:/data ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the Oryx, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt` via a browser.

### Step 2: Publish a live stream to Oryx

You can use OBS or FFmpeg to publish a live stream to Oryx. You can also set up HTTPS and publish via WebRTC.

Once the stream is published, you can preview it using an H5 player or VLC.

### Step 3: Forward to YouTube

To forward your stream to YouTube, copy the Stream URL and Stream key from your YouTube [Go live](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC/livestreaming) page.
