## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by one click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name srs-stack -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 2022:2022 -p 2443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt`.

## Step 2: Get the WHIP URL from SRS Stack

Please download OBS version 30 or higher from [this link](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases) 
and proceed with the installation.

Open the SRS Stack, select `Scenarios > Streaming > WebRTC: WHIP OBS`, and follow the instructions to 
get a WHIP URL for OBS.

Please copy the WHIP URL as we will use it in OBS. Be aware that the WHIP stream can be played using the 
WHEP player or embedded into your WordPress website.

## Step 3: Publish WHIP via OBS to SRS Stack

Next, launch OBS and select `Settings > Stream`. Choose `WHIP` from the `Service` drop-down menu, and set
the WHIP URL into the `Server` field.

Now you can click the `Start Streaming` button to publish the WHIP stream to the SRS Stack.

## Step 4: Use WHEP to View the Stream

After publishing the stream, you can view it with a WebRTC HTML5 player. Access the WHEP player from the 
SRS Stack dashboard.
