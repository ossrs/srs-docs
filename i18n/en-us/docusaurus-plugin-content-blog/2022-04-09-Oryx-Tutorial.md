# How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click

## Introduction

Streaming video is very popular in a variety of industries, and there are many tutorials for building a 
media server, using [SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs) or [NGINX-RTMP](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) 
that host stream does not rely on other service providers.

Literally it's not just a media server, and seems a bit complicated, right? Yep and No!

* Yep! Building a video streaming service is something really difficult, not easy. It requires video streaming engineering, also backend service technology like Nodejs or Go, and frontend skills to build a mgmt and homepage.
* No! Rather than build all from scratch, we could build a video streaming service based on some open source solution such as [Oryx](https://github.com/ossrs/oryx), and lightweight cloud service such as [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) or [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com), it's really simple to build your video streaming service.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set-up a video streaming service, supports publishing by browser 
without a plugin that is converting WebRTC to HLS, to deliver low latency (about 300ms) video streaming 
using SRT, and to secure the service by authentication. Furthermore, this solution is open source and very 
easy to get it done, via even 1-Click.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

1. OBS installed, following instructions [here](https://obsproject.com/) to download and install OBS.
1. A virtual private server (VPS) instance, such as [AWS Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com), [DigitalOcean Droplets](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets), or another similar service.
1. Optionally, you may choose to utilize Oryx on your local network or personal computer. Ensure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed for this purpose.

This guide will use placeholder `your_public_ipv4` and `your_domain_name` throughout for streaming URLs. 
Please replace them with your own IP address or domain name.

## Step 1.1: Create an Oryx using AWS Lightsail

Sign up for an AWS account and sign in to [AWS Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com). Next, click the 
`Create instance` button. Select the `Linux/Unix` platform and the `OS Only` blueprint. Finally, choose 
`Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` as the instance image.

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-21.png)

Next, click the `Add launch script` button and input the following script that will be executed to install 
the Oryx once the instance has been created.

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-22.png)

Please input the following script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossrs/oryx/HEAD/scripts/lightsail.sh)"
```

> Note: You can also access the instance and run the script manually. Please search for instructions on how
> to log in to a Lightsail instance.

Next, choose the instance plan, select the `2vCPUs 1GB` plan or a higher one, and click on `Create instance`.

Once the instance has been established, access the `Networking` tab and click `Attach static IP` to keep it 
from changing. Within `IPv4 Firewall`, press the `Add rule` option, add an `All protocols` rule and click 
the `Create` button:

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-23.png)

Now, the Oryx is created! Open `http://your_public_ipv4/mgmt/` in the browser, click the `Submit` button
to set-up the administrator password for the first time.

## Step 1.2: Create an Oryx using Docker

If you prefer not to utilize AWS Lightsail, have an alternative VPS, or even a virtual machine or personal 
computer locally available, highly recommend using Docker for a simple and efficient way to run Oryx on 
VPS using just one command:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/oryx:5
```

After the Oryx is created, open `http://your_public_ipv4/mgmt/` in the browser, click the `Submit` button
to set-up the administrator password for the first time.

## Step 1.3: Create an Oryx using DigitalOcean Droplets

You can use DigitalOcean droplet to run Oryx just one-click. A droplet is a simple and scalable virtual machine
of DigitalOcean. An SRS Droplet is a droplet with Oryx installed, to power your video streaming service. 

You could create `an SRS Droplet` by [clicking here](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/srs), 
then click the `Create SRS Droplet` button, set-up the droplet `Region` and `Size`, then click `Create Droplet` 
button at the bottom.

> Note: Recommend the size `2vCPUs 2GB` or slightly larger.

After the Oryx is created, open `http://your_public_ipv4/mgmt/` in the browser, click the `Submit` button
to set-up the administrator password for the first time.

## Step 2: Publish Stream using OBS

OBS is more simple to use, and SRS provides guide for OBS, please click `Scenarios > Streaming > RTMP: OBS or vMix` 
or open URL `http://your_public_ipv4/mgmt/en/routers-scenario?tab=live` with `Server` and `StreamKey` for OBS, 
please copy these config and paste to OBS:

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-01.png)

> Note: There is also a guide for publishing streams by FFmpeg and WebRTC, however, it's a bit complex for 
> WebRTC, and we will talk about it later.

After publishing an RTMP stream to SRS, you're able to play the stream by HTTP-FLV or HLS, by clicking the H5
player link, or play the URL by [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).

> Note: The latency of VLC is huge, so please use [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/) to play the RTMP or HTTP-FLV 
> if you wanna a low latency live streaming.

Now we have finished the basic live streaming publishing and playing, note that the `Stream Key` contains a 
`secret` which is used for authentication. Without this secret, SRS will deny the publisher, so only people 
who know about the secret could publish an RTMP stream.

While for players, the URL is public and no `secret` thing, because generally we don't need to do authentication 
for players. However, SRS is planned to support more authentication algorithms, including token for players, 
or limits for number of connections, or disconnecting connections if they exceed a period of duration.

## Step 3: Publish by WebRTC (Optional)

WebRTC or H5 is very convenient for users to share their camera, by just opening a H5 URL, to start live 
streaming like what OBS does. Please follow [secure SRS with let's encrypt](https://blog.ossrs.io/how-to-secure-srs-with-lets-encrypt-by-1-click-cb618777639f) 
tutorial.

Because WebRTC requires HTTPS, so you need a fully registered domain name, you could purchase a domain 
name on [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) or [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/), however we will use 
placeholder `your_domain_name` throughout this tutorial.

When you get a domain name, make sure a DNS record set-up for your server, please add an `A record` with 
`your_domain_name` pointing to your server public IP address that is `your_public_ipv4` as we said, see 
[Domains and DNS](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/how-to/manage-records/#a-records).

Now please switch to `System / HTTPS / Let's Encrypt` and enter `your_domain_name`, then click `Submit` 
button to request a free SSL cert from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-02.png)

When the HTTPS is ready, please open the URL `https://your_domain_name/mgmt` to access `Scenarios > Streaming > WebRTC: WHIP Browser` 
and open the URL to publish using WebRTC: 

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-03.png)

> Remark: Please note that the website and stream URLs have changed to HTTPS, both HTTPS-FLV, HLS and WebRTC.

The bellow is a demo for publishing by WebRTC and playing by HTTP-FLV or HLS:

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-04.png)

WebRTC is a bit more complex than RTMP or HLS, but using the feature by SRS, it's also very simple to set-up 
the HTTPS website and WebRTC signaling API, and the demo pages for WebRTC publisher and player are also very 
simple to use.

## Step 4: Low Latency Streaming by SRT (Optional)

For RTMP/FLV, the streaming latency is about `3~5s`, while `5~10s` for HLS. Which protocol to use if we want to 
build a low latency live streaming service, say, less than 1s?

WebRTC? No! It's too complicated, and few devices support WebRTC. [WHIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wish-whip/) 
is a possible choice for live streaming using WebRTC, but it's not a RFC right now(at 2022). It might take a long 
time to apply WebRTC to the live streaming industry, especially if we get other choices, [SRT](https://www.srtalliance.org/) 
and [RIST](https://www.rist.tv/) etc.

> Note: Whatever, Oryx allows you to use WebRTC for live streaming, to publish by WebRTC and play by 
> RTMP/HLS/WebRTC.

It's also very easy to use SRT, by clicking `Scenarios > Streaming > SRT: OBS or vMix`, the guide is use 
OBS to publish SRT stream, and play by ffplay. The latency of `OBS+ffplay` is about 300ms, the bellow is
a lower solution, by `vMix+ffplay`:

![](/img/blog-2022-04-09-05.png)

> Note: The end-to-end latency of SRT is 200ms to 500ms, good enough! Well, WebRTC is about 50ms to 300ms 
> latency. WebRTC is even lower than SRT, but WebRTC also introduces more pause events and the streaming 
> is not smooth as SRT.

SRT is supported by a lot of devices of the broadcasting industry, and softwares like OBS/vMix also support 
SRT, so it's actually the most stable and easy way to get low latency live streaming.

Note that H5 does not support SRT, so you can't use Chrome to play a SRT stream, however, Oryx will 
convert SRT to HTTP-FLV/HLS to ensure compability with general live streaming.

## Other Topics

Oryx also supports restreaming to other platforms, by forking multiple FFmpeg processes, each process 
for a stream. It's a long story, so let's discuss it in a new tutorial.

Well DVR is another story, DVR means we convert live streaming to VoD files, so we must save the VoD files 
to a cloud storage. So we're developing to support more cloud storage now.

We're also considering to integrate a CMS to Oryx, to allow users to publish the live streaming rooms, 
or VoD files like a vlog, etc.

Oryx is a single node video streaming service, but SRS is a media server that supports clusters, like
[Origin Cluster](../docs/v4/doc/origin-cluster), [RTMP Edge Cluster](../docs/v4/doc/sample-rtmp-cluster) and 
even [HLS Edge Cluster](../docs/v4/doc/sample-hls-cluster). The HLS Edge Cluster is based on NGINX, and SRS 
could work well with NGINX, we will publish more tutorials about this topic if you wanna.

## Cloud Service

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one, 
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

Additionally, we offer a [Cloud](../cloud) service for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from 
scratch. Our cloud service features global network acceleration, enhanced congestion control algorithms, 
client SDKs for all platforms, and some free quota.

To learn more about our cloud service, click [here](../cloud).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you build a video streaming service only by 1-Click, but with powerful features like 
authentication, SRT and WebRTC etc. If you have further questions about SRS, 
[the wiki](../docs/v6/doc/getting-started-oryx) is a good place to start.
