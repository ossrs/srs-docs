# Efficient Live Streaming Transcoding for Reducing Bandwidth and Saving Costs

## Introduction

In today's digital world, live streaming has become an essential tool for businesses, content creators, and 
individuals alike. With the increasing number of viewers tuning in to watch live streams, it's crucial to optimize 
the streaming experience and cost for everyone, regardless of their internet speed or device capabilities. One 
effective way to achieve this is through live streaming transcoding, a process that can help reduce bandwidth 
and save costs without compromising on video quality. In this blog, we'll explore the benefits of using SRS Stack 
for efficient live streaming transcoding and how it can lead to significant cost savings.

Live streaming transcoding involves converting a live stream from SRS Stack using FFmpeg into various bitrates and 
resolutions, before pushing it back to SRS Stack. This process allows for a reduction in bandwidth while maintaining 
the same quality, simply by lowering the bitrate of the stream. As a result, the overall viewing bandwidth is
decreased, leading to cost savings for both the streamer and the viewer.

For instance, consider a live streaming scenario with 10,000 viewers all watching the same 2Mbps bitrate stream. 
By transcoding the stream to 1Mbps, the required bandwidth is reduced to 10Gbps, resulting in a 50% cost saving. 
This not only benefits the content provider but also ensures a smoother streaming experience for viewers with 
varying internet speeds and devices.

Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the world of live streaming transcoding, and learn how to harness the power 
of SRS Stack to optimize your streaming experience and save costs.

## Step 1: Create SRS Stack by One Click

Creating an SRS Stack is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an SRS Stack with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name srs-stack -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/srs-stack:5
```

After creating the SRS Stack, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt` via a browser.

## Step 2: Publish a Live Stream to SRS Stack

You can use OBS or FFmpeg to publish a live stream to SRS Stack. You can also set up HTTPS and publish via WebRTC.

Once the stream is published, you can preview it using an H5 player or VLC.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-SRS-Stack-Tutorial.md) for detail.

## Step 3: Transcode the Live Stream to Lower Bitrate

Suppose you've sent an 8Mbps stream to SRS Stack using OBS, and you can't adjust the bitrate in OBS. This could 
be because the stream is published by a vendor you can't control, or you need to record the original high-resolution 
stream, or some devices like 4K/8K TVs require the high-resolution stream.

However, most of your viewers watch the live stream on mobile devices, and they don't need an 8Mbps stream. A 2Mbps 
stream is sufficient for mobile devices, and their bandwidth may only support a 2Mbps bitrate. In this case, you can
use transcoding to convert the 8Mbps stream into a 2Mbps live stream.

After transcoding the stream, you can preview the 2Mbps version or forward it to another live streaming platform.
See [Easily Stream Your RTSP IP Camera to YouTube, Twitch, or Facebook](./2023-10-11-SRS-Stack-Stream-IP-Camera-Events.md) 
for more information. You can also pull the RTMP stream from SRS Stack and forward it elsewhere.

## Check Transcoding Status

You can check the transcoding status in the SRS Stack dashboard.

You can click the preview link to check the transcoded stream, or forward it to another live streaming platform.
See [Easily Stream Your RTSP IP Camera to YouTube, Twitch, or Facebook](./2023-10-11-SRS-Stack-Stream-IP-Camera-Events.md)
for more information.

## Cloud Service

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one, 
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

Additionally, we offer a [Cloud](../cloud) service for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from 
scratch. Our cloud service features global network acceleration, enhanced congestion control algorithms, 
client SDKs for all platforms, and some free quota.

## Conclusion

In summary, we discussed the benefits of live streaming transcoding using SRS Stack and FFmpeg. Transcoding optimizes 
streaming for viewers with different internet speeds and devices, reduces bandwidth usage, and saves costs. We 
covered setting up SRS Stack and FFmpeg, creating a configuration file, and pushing transcoded streams back to 
SRS Stack. Monitoring and adjusting settings is crucial for optimal viewer experience, and transcoding can also 
convert high-resolution streams to lower resolutions for mobile devices.
