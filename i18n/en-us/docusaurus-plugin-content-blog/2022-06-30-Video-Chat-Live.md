# Video Chat Live

This decade has seen rapid development in audio and video technology, from interactive entertainment and live e-commerce to online conferences and online education, with the recent rise of the metaverse, audio and video being one of the fundamental capabilities.

Starting from the live streaming with video chat scenario, we can understand the technologies involved in internet audio and video. By delving deeper into the relevant technical points of audio and video, we can build a complete audio and video technology system and quickly apply it to online businesses.

## Cloud Service

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one, 
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

Additionally, we offer a [Cloud](../cloud) service for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from 
scratch. Our cloud service features global network acceleration, enhanced congestion control algorithms, 
client SDKs for all platforms, and some free quota.
