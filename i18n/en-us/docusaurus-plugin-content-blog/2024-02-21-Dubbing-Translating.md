In this blog, we will discuss how Oryx supports dubbing and translating video files from one language to 
another, such as converting a video with English speech to Chinese subtitles and speech. We will explore how 
this technology can help you appeal to a broader audience and unlock the full potential of your content, all 
while being incredibly easy to use and wallet-friendly. So, buckle up as we dive into the world of multilingual 
video content with Oryx!

## Step 1: Create Oryx by One Click

Creating an Oryx is simple and can be done with just one click if you use Digital Ocean droplet.
Please see [How to Setup a Video Streaming Service by 1-Click](./2022-04-09-Oryx-Tutorial.md) for detail.

You can also use Docker to create an Oryx with a single command line:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \
  ossrs/oryx:5
```

After creating the Oryx, you can access it through `http://your-server-ip/mgmt` via a browser.

## Step 2: Upload Video Source File

First, please upload the video source file, click the `Dubbing > Video Source > Upload local file > Upload File` to upload.

> Note: You can also use other tools to upload the file under the `/data` directory, and use the `Use server file` to directly use it.

## Step 3: Setup OpenAI Secret Key for Dubbing

To use AI services, you must obtain a secret key from OpenAI. Please open the [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
page in your browser and click the `Create new secret key` button. Once the key is created, copy it and set it in Oryx.

Next, configure the OpenAI secret key in `Dubbing Settings > ASR Settings`. Afterward, click on the
`Test OpenAI Service` button, and if no errors are detected during testing, click on `Update` button.

to translate in `Dubbing Settings > Multilingual Translation > Instructions` by setting the prompts, click on 
`Update` button.
