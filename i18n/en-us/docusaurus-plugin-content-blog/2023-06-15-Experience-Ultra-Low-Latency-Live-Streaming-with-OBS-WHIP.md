# Ultra-Low Latency Streaming with OBS WHIP: New Features & Stable Performance!

OBS now features WHIP support, with the patch having been recently merged. This enables 
various new functions and possibilities with OBS WHIP, as the latency drops from 1 second 
to 200 milliseconds.

Without OBS WHIP, you can employ RTMP+WebRTC for live streaming, which results in a latency 
of approximately 500ms. However, by using OBS WHIP, you can achieve low-latency live 
streaming with a latency of around 200ms.

Furthermore, even in situations with poor network connections or when streaming over the 
internet, OBS WHIP maintains a consistently low and stable latency.

In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to effortlessly utilize OBS WHIP with SRS in just 
three simple steps.

The SRS Stack also supports OBS WHIP, enabling you to establish a WHIP service with just one click. 
Refer to [Effortlessly Create a Public Internet WHIP Service for OBS](./2023-12-12-SRS-Stack-OBS-WHIP-Service.md).

docker run --rm -it -p 1935:1935 -p 1985:1985 -p 8080:8080 \
    --env CANDIDATE=$CANDIDATE -p 8000:8000/udp \
    ossrs/srs:5 ./objs/srs -c conf/rtmp2rtc.conf
```

> Note: Please set the CANDIDATE to your own IP. About CANDIDATE, please read [CANDIDATE](/docs/v5/doc/webrtc#config-candidate)

For configuration details, refer to [this post](/docs/v5/doc/getting-started#webrtc-for-live-streaming).

## Step 2: Run OBS

Open OBS and click `Settings` to configure the following:

1. Open OBS and click **Settings**.
1. Click **Stream** on the left sidebar.
1. Select `WHIP` for **Service**.

## Cloud Service and Support

I tested the TRTC cloud service and it works great with OBS WHIP. If you're looking for 
a WHIP cloud service that has 24/7 support, I definitely suggest trying TRTC. To see a 
demo, click [here](https://tencent-rtc.github.io/obs-trtc/).

## Cloud Service

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one, 
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

Additionally, we offer a [cloud](/cloud) service for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from 
scratch. Our cloud service features global network acceleration, enhanced congestion control algorithms, 
client SDKs for all platforms, and some free quota.

To learn more about our cloud service, click [here](/docs/v6/doc/cloud).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the ultra-low latency live streaming capabilities of OBS WHIP and 
demonstrated how to set it up with SRS in just three simple steps. OBS WHIP significantly reduces 
latency, making it an excellent option for low-latency live streaming.
