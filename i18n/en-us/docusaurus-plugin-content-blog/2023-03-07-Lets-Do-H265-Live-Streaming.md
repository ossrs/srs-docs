# Let's Do H265 Live Streaming

> Written by [Winlin](https://github.com/winlinvip), [runner365](https://github.com/runner365), [yinjiaoyuan](https://github.com/yinjiaoyuan), [PieerePi](https://github.com/PieerePi), [qichaoshen82](https://github.com/qichaoshen82), [ZSC714725](https://github.com/ZSC714725), [bluestn](https://github.com/bluestn), [mapengfei53](https://github.com/mapengfei53), [chundonglinlin](https://github.com/chundonglinlin), [duiniuluantanqin](https://github.com/duiniuluantanqin), [panda1986](https://github.com/panda1986)

SRS 6.0 supports HEVC(H.265), for RTMP, HTTP-FLV, HTTP-TS, HLS, MPEG-DASH, WebRTC(Safari), DVR FLV, DVR MP4 and WordPress SrsPlayer, etc.

Generally, H.265 is 50% off than H.264, so you only need to pay 50% bills if H.265.

<!--truncate-->

Now, you're able to use HEVC(H.265) in live streaming.

## Why Important?

H.265 uses less bandwidth than H.264, which means lower bandwidth cost, or higher quality in same bandwidth.

Furthermore, if want 8K live streaming, you must use H.265, because H.264 doesn't support 8K resolution.

Please note that there are still some traps for H.265 live streaming.

## Status of H.265

The status of H.265, for different use scenarios.

Part 1, publisher or encoder for H.265.

* [ ] Not supported: HTTP Callback takes HEVC metadata.
* [ ] Not supported: Prometheus Exporter supports HEVC metadata.
* [ ] Not supported: Improve coverage for HEVC.
* [ ] Not supported: Supports benchmark for HEVC by [srs-bench](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-bench).

If native iOS or Android application, please use FFmpeg.

Appreciate the patch for [Chrome 105](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/541082191) to support HEVC for MSE, it makes the HEVC
live streaming possible.

MSE HEVC requires GPU hardware decoding, please open `chrome://gpu` then search `hevc`, and it should work if matched.

## Usage: Live

This is an example fo H.265 live streaming.

First, build SRS 6.0.31+, and enable H.265:

```bash
git checkout develop
./configure --h265=on && make
```

Next, run SRS with SRT, HTTP-FLV and HLS:

```bash
env SRS_LISTEN=1935 SRS_DAEMON=off SRS_LOG_TANK=console \
  SRS_SRT_SERVER_ENABLED=on SRS_VHOST_SRT_ENABLED=on SRS_VHOST_SRT_TO_RTMP=on \
  SRS_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED=on SRS_VHOST_HTTP_REMUX_ENABLED=on \
  SRS_VHOST_HTTP_REMUX_MOUNT=[vhost]/[app]/[stream].flv SRS_VHOST_HLS_ENABLED=on \
  ./objs/srs -e
```

Now, run FFmpeg to publish by SRT with H.265 stream:

```bash
ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -re -i doc/source.flv -acodec copy -vcodec libx265 \
  -pes_payload_size 0 -f mpegts 'srt://127.0.0.1:10080?streamid=#!::r=live/livestream,m=publish'
```

Done, please open links bellow in browser:

* [http://localhost:8080/live/livestream.flv](http://localhost:8080/players/srs_player.html?stream=livestream.flv)
* `http://localhost:8080/live/livestream.m3u8`

> Note: Please use VLC or ffplay to play HLS, because hls.js doesn't support it.

Please follow wiki of SRS to use other protocols.

## Usage: WebRTC

Right now, at 2023.03, only Safari support HEVC over WebRTC, neither Chrome nor Firefox supports it.

And, you should enable the HEVC for Safari by clicking `Develop > Experimental Features > WebRTC H265 codec`.

For detail usage, please follow [#465](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/issues/465#safari-webrtc).

Beside HEVC, WebRTC has better support for AV1, Safari/Chrome/Firefox supports AV1, please read [#1070](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/issues/1070) for detail.
Note that MSE doesn't support AV1.

> Note: Media Source Extensions (MSE) is H5 API for media streaming, on which mpegts.js, hls.js and dash.js bases. Please see [MDN: MSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API).

## FFmpeg Patch

FFmpeg/ffplay doesn't suport HEVC over RTMP/HTTP-FLV, there are some patches:

* Runner365, support FFmpeg 4/5/6, please see [ffmpeg_rtmp_h265](https://github.com/runner365/ffmpeg_rtmp_h265). SRS also uses this patch.
* Intel [0001-Add-SVT-HEVC-FLV-support-on-FFmpeg.patch](https://github.com/VCDP/CDN/blob/master/FFmpeg_patches/0001-Add-SVT-HEVC-FLV-support-on-FFmpeg.patch)
* Ksvc updates FLV [specfication](https://github.com/ksvc/FFmpeg/wiki) and [usage](https://github.com/ksvc/FFmpeg/wiki/hevcpush).

SRS dev-docker already patched FFmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe, so user can use it:

```bash
# For macOS
docker run --rm -it ossrs/srs:encoder ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -re -i doc/source.flv \
  -acodec copy -vcodec libx265 -f flv rtmp://host.docker.internal/live/livestream

# For linux
docker run --net=host --rm -it ossrs/srs:encoder ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -re -i doc/source.flv \
  -acodec copy -vcodec libx265 -f flv rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/livestream
```

> Note: You can also copy the binary from the docker, or refer to [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossrs/dev-docker/blob/ubuntu20/Dockerfile.base51) to build by yourself.

Please see [FFmpeg Tools](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/issues/465#ffmpeg-tools) for detail.

## Known Issues

The known issues for HEVC live streaming:

1. Safari HEVC WebRTC doesn't support converting to other protocols, such as RTMP.
2. Chrome/Firefox WebRTC doesn't support HEVC, no plan also.
3. All browsers support MSE except iOS, and note that HEVC MSE requires GPU hardware decoding.
4. For H5 player, only mpegts.js supports HEVC, neither hls.js nor dash.js support it.

On some use scenario, HEVC is available now, please evaluate it by yourself.
