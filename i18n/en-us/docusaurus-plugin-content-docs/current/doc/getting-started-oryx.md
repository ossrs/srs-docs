# Oryx

Oryx(SRS Stack) is a video cloud solution that is lightweight, open-source, and based on Go,
Reactjs, SRS, FFmpeg, WebRTC, etc.

## Introduction

Oryx, an open-source out-of-the-box audio and video solution, is built entirely based on various scenarios. 
Common examples include push-pull streaming scenarios that support different protocols and can be embedded into 
websites like WordPress. 

In recording scenarios, it supports merging multiple streams, setting filters, and recording specific streams only. 
For forwarding and virtual live streaming, files and other streams can be sent to different platforms or to Oryx 
itself. With AI automatic subtitles, OpenAI's capabilities can be utilized to automatically recognize and embed 
subtitles into the video stream. One-click automatic HTTPS makes it easy to enable HTTPS capabilities. 

More diverse scenarios will be available in the future.

## FAQ

If you encounter issues while using Oryx, please read the [FAQ](../../../faq-oryx) first.

## Usage

Please select your platform.

> Remark: Please choose the Ubuntu 20 system, as other systems may encounter some strange issues.

### Docker

Strongly recommend running Oryx with docker:

```bash
docker run --restart always -d -it --name oryx -v $HOME/data:/data \
  -p 80:2022 -p 443:2443 -p 1935:1935 -p 8000:8000/udp -p 10080:10080/udp \

### Streaming and Authentication

Oryx support enhanced streaming with authentication, based on SRS callback. Oryx generate and save 
the stream token to Redis, and verify the stream token when user publish stream via RTMP, SRT, or WHIP/WebRTC.

Oryx also proxies and secures all the HTTP API of SRS, so only authenticated user can access the HTTP API 
and the console.

### DVR

Oryx support DVR or Recording, to convert live stream to file, then save to local disk or cloud storage. 
We also support merge multiple republish session to one DVR file, and support set filters for recording specified 
streams.

See [A Step-by-Step Guide to Server-Side Recording and AWS S3 Integration](../../../blog/Record-Live-Streaming) for details.

### Automatic HTTPS

Oryx support automatic HTTPS, just by one click, you can enable HTTPS for your Oryx. Oryx will 
automatically request and update the HTTPS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Automatic HTTPS
allows WHIP or publish by webpage, and also support WebRTC, and access user's microphones.

See [How to Secure SRS with Let's Encrypt by 1-Click](../../../blog/Oryx-HTTPS) for details.

### Virtual Live Events

You can use prerecorded videos to simulate live events. You can do 7x24 live stream with only 1 video file. You can
also pull stream to your live room, to make the live stream powerful. You can even pull your IP camera stream to your 
live room.

See [Harness the Power of Pre-Recorded Content for Seamless and Engaging Live Streaming Experiences](../../../blog/Virtual-Live-Events) and 
[Easily Stream Your RTSP IP Camera to YouTube, Twitch, or Facebook](../../../blog/Stream-IP-Camera-Events).

### Restream

With Oryx, you can restream to multiple platforms, like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc. Oryx will 
automatically select a stream to forward, so you can publish multiple streams as fault-tolerant or backup 
stream, when a stream is down, Oryx will switch to another one.

See [Effortlessly Restream Live Content Across Multiple Platforms with Oryx](../../../blog/Multi-Platform-Streaming) for details.

### AI Transcription

Oryx supports AI transcription, which is powered by OpenAI, to convert live speech to text and overlay to 
the video stream as a new live stream. With this feature, allows you to engage more audiences, especially for people 
with hearing disabilities or those who are non-native speakers.

See [Creating Accessible, Multilingual Subtitles for Diverse Audiences](../../../blog/live-streams-transcription) for details.

### Transcode

Oryx suppport transcoding live stream, to decrease the bitrate and save bandwidth and cost, or filter the 
live stream content to make it better.

See [Efficient Live Streaming Transcoding for Reducing Bandwidth and Saving Costs](../../../blog/Live-Transcoding) for details.

## HTTP API

You can open the `System > OpenAPI` to get the Bearer token and try the HTTP API.

You can click the button on the web to request a HTTP API, you can also use the curl or js code to request the 
HTTP API. Please follow the instructions on the web, for example, use curl to request the HTTP API:

```bash
curl http://localhost/terraform/v1/mgmt/versions
```

Or with the Bearer token:

```bash
curl http://localhost/terraform/v1/hooks/srs/secret/query \
  -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{}'
```

> Note: You can open the `System > OpenAPI` to get the Bearer token and try the HTTP API.

> Note: The web may use JWT token, but you can also use Bearer token to request the HTTP API.

In addition to the sample APIs listed on this page, users can perform all web-based actions through the 
HTTP API. To identify the requests and responses for each API, open Google Chrome, navigate to 
`View > Developer > Developer Tools` click on the `Network` tab, and examine the relevant API interactions.

Oryx also proxy the [SRS HTTP API](./http-api.md), which prefix with `/api/v1/` such as:

```bash
curl http://localhost/api/v1/versions
```

Or with the Bearer token:

```bash
curl http://localhost/api/v1/vhosts/ \
  -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

> Note: You can open the `System > OpenAPI` to get the Bearer token and try the HTTP API.

Please read the detail about the API from the [SRS HTTP API](./http-api.md).

## HTTP Callback

HTTP Callback refers to the Oryx running within a Docker container, initiating an HTTP request to
a target URL. For instance, the following process illustrates that when OBS publishs an RTMP stream to Oryx,
the Oryx informs your server about the event by sending an HTTP request to the target URL.

```bash
                   +-----------------------+
                   +                       +
+-------+          +     +-----------+     +                 +--------------+
+  OBS  +--RTMP->--+-----+ Oryx +-----+----HTTP--->-----+  Your Server +
+-------+          +     +-----------+     +  (Target URL)   +--------------+
                   +                       +
                   +       Docker          +
                   +-----------------------+
```

All HTTP requests should be:

* `Content-Type: application-json`

All responses should use:

* `Status: 200 OK` and `{"code": 0}` for success.
* Otherwise, error or fail.

See examples in [HTTP Callback](../docs/v7/doc/http-callback#go-example)

### HTTP Callback: Connectivity Check

Occasionally, you might need to verify if the network is accessible and determine the appropriate target URL to
use. By using the curl command inside the Docker container, you can simulate this request and confirm if the
target URL can be accessed by curl or the Oryx.

First, install curl in Oryx:

```bash
docker exec -it oryx apt-get update -y
docker exec -it oryx apt-get install -y curl
```

Then, simulate an HTTP request to your server:

```bash
docker exec -it oryx curl http://your-target-URL
```

You can use any target URL to test, such as:

* Intranet IP: `http://192.168.1.10/check`
* Internet IP: `http://159.133.96.20/check`
* URL via HTTP: `http://your-domain.com/check`
* URL via HTTPS: `https://your-domain.com/check`

Keep in mind that you should test the connection to the target URL within the Oryx Docker, and avoid
running the curl command from a different server.
