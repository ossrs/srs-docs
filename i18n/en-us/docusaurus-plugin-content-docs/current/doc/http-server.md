# HTTP Server

SRS Embeded a HTTP web server, supports api and simple HTTP file for HLS.

To deploy SRS HTTP server, read [Usage: HTTP](./sample-http.md)

The SRS Embeded HTTP server is rewrite refer to go http module, so it's ok to use srs as http server. Read [#277](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/issues/277)

> Remark: The SRS HTTP server is just a origin HTTP server, for HTTP edge server, please use NGINX, SQUID and ATS.

SRS also works well with HTTP reverse proxy servers, like [NGINX](#nginx-proxy) and [Caddy](#caddy-proxy).

## Use Scenario

The SRS Embeded HTTP server is design to provides basic HTTP service, 
like the camera of mobile phone.

SRS should provides HTTP api, which is actually a embeded HTTP server.

Actually, RTMP is more complex than HTTP, so HTTP server on st is absolutely ok.
The HTTP Server in SRS1.0 is expirement, I will enhance it future.

## Config

Config the HTTP port and root.

```bash
# embeded http server in srs.
# the http streaming config, for HLS/HDS/DASH/HTTPProgressive
# global config for http streaming, user must config the http section for each vhost.
# the embed http server used to substitute nginx in ./objs/nginx,
# for example, srs runing in arm, can provides RTMP and HTTP service, only with srs installed.
# user can access the http server pages, generally:
#       curl http://192.168.1.170:80/srs.html
# which will show srs version and welcome to srs.
# @remeark, the http embeded stream need to config the vhost, for instance, the __defaultVhost__
# need to open the feature http of vhost.
http_server {
    # whether http streaming service is enabled.
    # default: off
    enabled         on;
    # the http streaming port
    # @remark, if use lower port, for instance 80, user must start srs by root.
    # default: 8080
    listen          8080;
    # the default dir for http root.
    # default: ./objs/nginx/html
    dir             ./objs/nginx/html;
}
```

And, each vhost can specifies the dir.

```bash
vhost your_vhost {
    # http static vhost specified config
    http_static {
        # whether enabled the http static service for vhost.
        # default: off
        enabled     on;
        # the url to mount to, 
        # typical mount to [vhost]/
        # the variables:
        #       [vhost] current vhost for http server.
        # @remark the [vhost] is optional, used to mount at specified vhost.
        # @remark the http of __defaultVhost__ will override the http_stream section.
        # for example:
        #       mount to [vhost]/
        #           access by http://ossrs.net:8080/xxx.html
        #       mount to [vhost]/hls
        #           access by http://ossrs.net:8080/hls/xxx.html
        #       mount to /
        #           access by http://ossrs.net:8080/xxx.html
        #           or by http://192.168.1.173:8080/xxx.html
        #       mount to /hls
        #           access by http://ossrs.net:8080/hls/xxx.html
        #           or by http://192.168.1.173:8080/hls/xxx.html
        # default: [vhost]/
        mount       [vhost]/hls;
        # main dir of vhost,
        # to delivery HTTP stream of this vhost.
        # default: ./objs/nginx/html
        dir         ./objs/nginx/html/hls;
    }
}
```

Remark: The `http_stream` of SRS1 renamed to `http_server` in SRS2, which specifies the global HTTP server config, used to delivery http static files, for dvr files(HLS/FLV/HDS/MPEG-DASH).

Remark: The `http` of vhost of SRS1 renamed to `http_static`, similar to global `http_server` for HTTP static files delivery. While the `http_remux` introduced in SRS2 is dynamic remux RTMP to HTTP Live FLV/Mp3/Aac/HLS/Hds/MPEG-DASH stream.

## HTTPS Server

SRS supports HTTPS, just enable it in the configuration. By default, it uses a sub-signed certificate. If you need 
to use a CA-issued certificate, please replace the relevant files. The related configuration is as follows:

```bash
http_server {
    https {
        # Whether enable HTTPS Streaming.
        # Overwrite by env SRS_HTTP_SERVER_HTTPS_ENABLED
        # default: off
        enabled on;
        # The listen endpoint for HTTPS Streaming.
        # Overwrite by env SRS_HTTP_SERVER_HTTPS_LISTEN
        # default: 8088
        listen 8088;
        # The SSL private key file, generated by:
        #       openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
        # Overwrite by env SRS_HTTP_SERVER_HTTPS_KEY
        # default: ./conf/server.key
        key ./conf/server.key;
        # The SSL public cert file, generated by:
        #       openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650 -subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=Me/OU=Me/CN=ossrs.net"
        # Overwrite by env SRS_HTTP_SERVER_HTTPS_CERT
        # default: ./conf/server.crt
        cert ./conf/server.crt;
    }
}
```

## Crossdomain

SRS has CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support enabled by default. The related configuration is as follows:

```bash
http_server {
    # whether enable crossdomain request.
    # for both http static and stream server and apply on all vhosts.
    # Overwrite by env SRS_HTTP_SERVER_CROSSDOMAIN
    # default: on
    crossdomain on;
}
```

## MIME

Only some MIME is supported:

| File ext name | Content-Type |
| ------------- | -----------  |
| .ts | Content-Type: video/MP2T;charset=utf-8 |
| .m3u8 | Content-Type: application/x-mpegURL;charset=utf-8 |
| .json | Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8 |

| Others | Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8 |

## Method

Supported HTTP method:
* GET: Query API, or download file.

## Paths

HTTP/HTTPS API:

* `/api/` SRS HTTP API
* `/rtc/` SRS WebRTC API

HTTP/HTTPS Stream:

* `/{app}/{stream}` HTTP Stream mounted by publisher.

The bellow is some reverse proxy to work with SRS.

> Note: Generally, a proxy can be used to route API and Stream together based on the path.

## Nginx Proxy

The config for NGINX as file [nginx.conf](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/blob/develop/trunk/conf/nginx.proxy.conf):

```
worker_processes  1;
events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include             /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       443 ssl http2;
        server_name  _;
        ssl_certificate      /usr/local/srs/conf/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /usr/local/srs/conf/server.key;

        # For SRS homepage, console and players
        #   http://r.ossrs.net/console/
        #   http://r.ossrs.net/players/
        location ~ ^/(console|players)/ {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/$request_uri;
        }
        # For SRS streaming, for example:
        #   http://r.ossrs.net/live/livestream.flv
        #   http://r.ossrs.net/live/livestream.m3u8
        location ~ ^/.+/.*\.(flv|m3u8|ts|aac|mp3)$ {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080$request_uri;
        }
        # For SRS backend API for console.
        # For SRS WebRTC publish/play API.
        location ~ ^/(api|rtc)/ {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1985$request_uri;
        }
    }
}
```

## Caddy Proxy

The config for [CaddyServer](https://caddyserver.com/docs/getting-started) with automatic HTTPS, use the config file `Caddyfile`.

For HTTP server, note that to set the default port:

```
:80
reverse_proxy /* 127.0.0.1:8080
reverse_proxy /api/* 127.0.0.1:1985
reverse_proxy /rtc/* 127.0.0.1:1985
```

For HTTPS server, please enable a domain name:

```
example.com {
  reverse_proxy /* 127.0.0.1:8080
  reverse_proxy /api/* 127.0.0.1:1985
  reverse_proxy /rtc/* 127.0.0.1:1985
}
```

Start the CaddyServer:

```
caddy start -config Caddyfile
```

## Nodejs KOA Proxy

The nodejs koa proxy also works well for SRS, please use [koa-proxies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-proxies) based by [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy), here is an example:

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const proxy = require('koa-proxies');
const BodyParser = require('koa-bodyparser');
const Router = require('koa-router');

const app = new Koa();
app.use(proxy('/api/', {target: 'http://127.0.0.1:1985/'}));
app.use(proxy('/rtc/', {target: 'http://127.0.0.1:1985/'}));
app.use(proxy('/*/*.(flv|m3u8|ts|aac|mp3)', {target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'}));
app.use(proxy('/console/', {target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'}));
app.use(proxy('/players/', {target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'}));

// Start body-parser after proxies, see https://github.com/vagusX/koa-proxies/issues/55
app.use(BodyParser());

// APIs that depends on body-parser
const router = new Router();
router.all('/', async (ctx) => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello World';
});
app.use(router.routes());

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server start on http://localhost:3000`);
});
```

Save it as `index.js`, then run:

```
npm init -y 
npm install koa koa-proxies koa-proxies koa-bodyparser koa-router
node .
```

## HTTPX Proxy

Well [httpx-static](https://github.com/ossrs/go-oryx/tree/develop/httpx-static#usage) is a simple HTTP/HTTPS proxy written by Go:

```
go get github.com/ossrs/go-oryx/httpx-static
cd $GOPATH/bin
./httpx-static -http=80 -https=443 \
  -skey /usr/local/srs/etc/server.key -scert /usr/local/srs/etc/server.crt \
  -proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1985/api/v1/ \
  -proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1985/rtc/v1/ \
  -proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

> Please make sure the path `/` is the last one.
