HTTP-FLV, SRT, and MPEG-DASH. It acts as a media gateway, converting between RTMP, SRT, and WebRTC. SRS has several 
use cases, including as an origin cluster, for virtual live-streaming with SRS Cloud, with the SRS Player WordPress 
plugin, for Unity developers, in the broadcast industry, for AI video and audio processing, and for cutting 
live-streaming expenses. SRS is compatible with various open-source technologies and has a global community on 
Discord.
