# RTMP

RTMP is a basic and de facto standard protocol for live streaming for many years.

However, Adobe neither maintaining RTMP protocol nor contributing as an RFC protocol, so many new features
aren't supported by RTMP, such as HEVC and opus.

For live streaming producing, more recent years, SRT, WebRTC and RIST have been growing rapidly. More and
more devices supported SRT or RIST in live streaming. You're also able to use WebRTC for live streaming.

For live streaming deliver, HLS is the most common used protocol, is supported by almost all CDN and devices
such as PC, iOS, Android and tablet PC. However, HLS has large (3~5s+) latency, you could use HTTP-FLV,
HTTP-TS or WebRTC for low latency use scenario.

Today, RTMP is still used in live streaming producing, for example, OBS publish RTMP stream to YouTube, Twitch, etc.
If you want to ingest stream from a device or publish to a platform, RTMP is the right choice for compatibility.

## Usage

SRS supports RTMP by default, please run by [docker](./getting-started.md) or [build from source](./getting-started-build.md):

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 1935:1935 ossrs/srs:5 \
  ./objs/srs -c conf/rtmp.conf
```

Publish stream by [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) :

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i ./doc/source.flv -c copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/livestream
```

Play stream by:

* RTMP (by [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)): `rtmp://localhost/live/livestream`

SRS supports converting RTMP to other protocols, described in next sections.

## On Demand Live Streaming

In some situations, you might want to start streaming only when someone starts watching:

1. The streaming source connects to the system but doesn't send the stream to SRS.
2. The player connects to the system and requests to play the stream.
3. The system tells the streaming source to start sending the stream to SRS.
4. The player gets the stream from SRS and plays it.

> Note: The "system" here refers to your business system, not SRS.

This is called "on-demand live streaming" or "on-demand streaming." What happens if the player stops watching?

1. The system needs to tell the streaming source to stop sending the stream.
2. Or, when the last player stops watching, SRS waits for a while and then disconnects the stream.

The second solution is recommended, as it's easier to use. Your system won't need to tell the streaming source to stop, because SRS will disconnect it automatically. You just need to enable the following configuration:

```bash
# The timeout in seconds to disconnect publisher when idle, which means no players.
# Note that 0 means no timeout or this feature is disabled.
# Note that this feature conflicts with forward, because it disconnect the publisher stream.
# Overwrite by env SRS_VHOST_PUBLISH_KICKOFF_FOR_IDLE for all vhosts.
# default: 0
kickoff_for_idle 0;
```
