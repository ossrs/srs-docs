# Exec

## NGINX RTMP EXEC

SRS only support some exec introduced by NGINX RTMP:

1. exec/exec_publish: Support.
1. exec_pull: Not support.
1. exec_play: Not support.
1. exec_record_done: Not support.

> Note: You could use [HTTP Callback](./http-callback.md) to start FFmpeg on your backend server. It's much better solution.
