SRS has a community of thousands of developers.

On this page we've listed some SRS-related communities that you can be a part of; see the other pages in this section 
for additional online and in-person learning materials.

## Donation

We are an open-source community, with both code and documentation available for free. However, it is 
essential to spend time understanding the documentation and learning how to use this project. Most issues 
can be resolved through the documentation, and in cases where you still encounter problems, you can seek 
assistance from other community members. Friends in the community might offer help, but they are not 
obligated to do so, as it's a universal rule of open-source communities.

I have a full-time job and support the community during my spare time, focusing primarily on code and 
documentation development. As a result, I have limited time available for community support and prioritize
assistance to project contributors. If you wish for me to dedicate time specifically to assist you, you 
may consider becoming a backer or sponsor of the project.

Our documentation and code are open and free, so you don't need to sponsor the community to access these resources. We are a truly open-source community. For financial sponsors, we also offer additional support, including:

* Backer: $5 per month. Online text chat support through Discord. No custom development included.
* Sponsor: $100 per month. Online text chat and online meeting support. No custom development included.
* Custom Development: Must be a Backer or Sponsor first. Fees based on duration, evaluated separately. Please contact us on Discord.

Please visit [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/srs-server) to become a backer or sponsor, 
and send me a direct message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yZ4BnPmHAd).
