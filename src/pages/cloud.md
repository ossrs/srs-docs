# Cloud

At SRS, our goal is to establish a non-profit, open-source community dedicated to creating an all-in-one,
out-of-the-box, open-source video solution for live streaming and WebRTC online services.

We also offer cloud services for those who prefer to use cloud service instead of building from scratch.
Please choose the cloud service that best suits your needs.
